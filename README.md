# object-tracking
This repo contains implementations of some standard object tracking algorithms (SOT, nOT). 

Future work will aim at implementing more nOT-algorithms (MHT), as well as MOT (PHD, PMBM) and Extended MOT. 
I also plan on implementing the possiblity to collect data from and to test the algorithms on the CARLA-simulator.
